# Speaking and Topic Requests for Bmore C&C
A repository for speaking topic requests and talk submissions.

# Welcome
to [Baltimore Code & Coffee's](http://bmorecodecoffee.github.io/) repository for talks and topics.

This helps us organize and keep track of possible talks and topics that people want to give or are interested in hearing from.

## Interested in giving a talk?
Fill out a [new issue with the Talk template](https://github.com/BmoreCodeCoffee/speaking/issues/new?assignees=&labels=talk&template=talk.md&title=TITLE+OF+YOUR+TALK+HERE). Fill it out to the best of your ability and one of our co-organizers will contact you with follow up questions for scheduling.

## Want to attend a talk on a certain topic?
Fill out a [new issue with the Request template](https://github.com/BmoreCodeCoffee/speaking/issues/new?assignees=&labels=request&template=request.md&title=TOPIC%2FTITLE+OF+INTEREST+HERE). Fill it out to the best of your ability. **This is most helpful to us if you know someone or an organization** who would be interested in providing the talk. But if you don't know someone/an organization, that's okay. Knowing what you would be interested in helps us seek out future speakers.

## Interested in submitting a talk for our next Lightning Series :zap: ?
Whether there is an upcoming Lightning Series :zap: or not, if you're interested in participating in a future one, please fill out a [new issue with the Lightning template](https://github.com/BmoreCodeCoffee/speaking/issues/new?assignees=&labels=talk&template=lightning_talk.md&title=TITLE+OF+YOUR+TALK+HERE). A co-organizer will reach out to you when we're planning out next Lightning Series :zap: line up.

## Have questions/comments/concerns?
You can contact our organizers through [our meetup](https://www.meetup.com/baltimore-code-and-coffee/) or [the Baltimore Tech slack in the #code-and-coffee channel](https://baltimoretech-slack.herokuapp.com/).
